# Exercises about declaring methods

Create a class named `Methods` with the main method in the `methods` package.

1. Create a public method `printGreeting` which does not take in any parameters.
2. Fill the method so that it prints `"Good day!"` to the console when called.
3. Create a method `printSum`, which takes in two parameters: `double a, double b`.
4. Fill the method so that it prints the sum of the given arguments.
5. Modify the method `printGreeting` so that it takes in a parameter, `String name`,
   and prints `"Good day, {name}!"`.
6. Create a method `getSum(double a, double b)`, which would **return** the sum of instead of printing it.
7. Using the `getSum` method, calculate the result of the following expression: `(9981 + 44489) / (3349 + 10992)` and print it to the console.
8. Create a method `calculateTriangleArea(double height, double base)`, whereas the formula for the calculation is `(height * base) / 2`.
9. Create a method `calculateCircleArea(double radius)`, whereas the formula for the calculation is `PI * radius^2`. Here we will learn about the `Math` class.
10. Create a method `calculateRectangleArea(double width, double height)`, whereas the formula for the calculation is `width * height`.
