## EX 1 - Declaring variables, simple arithmetic

Create a class `VariablesAndOperators` with the main method in the `datatypes` package.
Do the following inside the main method:

1. Define a variable which could hold a value `456.78`.
2. Define a variable which denotes the character sequence `"test"`.
3. Define a variable which holds a boolean value and which has value `true`.
4. Define two different types of variables which could hold a value `'a'`.
5. Define variables which point to the following numbers: `5`, `91`, `304`, `405`.
6. Define variables which point to the following numbers: `56.7`, `45.8`, `91.2`.
7. Define variables which point to the following values:
   `"see on esimene väärtus"`,`67`, `58.92`
8. Define a variable which points to the following number and which is not of type `String`: `7676868683452352376`.
9. Calculate the sum of numbers `4` and `85`.
10. Calculate the product of numbers `10` and `54`.
11. Find the remainder which occurs when dividing `81` by `10`.
12. Find the remainder which occurs when dividing `66` by `10`.
13. Find the remainder which occurs when dividing `10000` by `10`.
14. Calculate the quotient of `15` and `4`.
15. Calculate the result of the following expression: `2^5`.
16. Create a variable which holds value `a`. Find its ASCII code.
17. Create another variable, which holds value `b`. Compare it to `a`.

## EX 2 - Elementary string processing

Create a class named `StringOperations` with the main method in the `datatypes` package.
Print the following sentences to the console:

1. Hello, World!
2. Hello "World"!
3. Steven Hawking once said: "Life would be tragic if it weren't funny".
4. When we concatenate strings "This is the first half  " and "This is the second half", the result will be "This is the first half This is the second half".
5. Life is beautiful.
6. Life is 'beautiful'.
7. Life is "beautiful".
8. The most confusing part is using the "-symbol inside the string.
9. 'Three' - three, 'four' - four, "five" - five.
10. Print characters 1, 2 and 3 from the word "lightning".
11. Compose a new word from characters 1, 5, 2 of the word "lightning" and print it.
12. Print out "Hello {name}" using `System.out.printf`. Then try the same with `String.format`.
